# Music App

This project aims to create an application allowing users to create bands, band members, and albums. Users have the capability to edit or delete bands, band members, and albums as desired. No user authentication is required for these actions. Additionally, users can write reviews and provide ratings for albums. If a user wishes to modify or delete their review and rating, they have the option to do so. However, authentication is necessary for this purpose, as only logged-in users can perform these actions. Non-members cannot write reviews, edit, or delete other users' reviews.

When one or more albums belonging to a specific band receive reviews, the particular band automatically receives a rating that can be visible on the platform. It's important to note that users can filter bands based on ratings, names, and genres to view the best-rated bands according to users' preferences when using the application.
